NetTray
=======

A small system tray utility that provides information about:

* Public IP address
* Local interfaces
* Network latency
* System uptime

It checks the public/private IPs and latency in the background. It will show an info bubble whenever the IP changes, if the latency becomes too high or the network connection drops. Configuration can be changed in the Registry.
